# MY Catalog App

My Catalog App is a tool to store information about all of your books in one central location.

This app also allows you to upload small book files to the database.
To start using the Catalog App, you can follow these steps:

1. Create an Account: Open the app and sign up by providing your name, email address, and a password. This will create a secure account for you to access your book catalog.

2. Add Books: Once you've created an account, you can start adding books to your catalog. You can manually enter book details, such as the title, author, genre, publication date, and any personal notes you want to include.

3. Upload Book Files: If you have small book files, you can easily upload them to the database. Make sure the files meet the upload size limit and are in a supported format. This way, you can have the actual book files accessible within the app.

4. Organize and Search: The Catalog App allows you to organize your books in various ways. You can create categories or tags for easier navigation and filtering. Plus, there's a search functionality that enables you to find specific books based on their title, author, or other criteria.

5. Edit and Update: As your book collection grows or you want to make changes to existing entries, you can easily edit and update the information in the app. Whether it's correcting a typo or adding additional details, the Catalog App is designed to keep your catalog accurate and up to date.
